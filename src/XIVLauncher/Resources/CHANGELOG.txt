• Compatibility with Patch 6.1
    => Plugins will not work yet! We are still working on fixing plugin support for this patch, and that may take a while. You don't have to do anything to fix them, they'll update automatically once we're done.

• Adds further checks for incompatible GShade installations. This will prevent your plugin windows from looking blurry, but won't change anything about your setup/presets.
